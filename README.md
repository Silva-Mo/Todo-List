## About  
This is my third JavaScript project from The Odin Project curriculum — a fully functional Todo List app.  
It strengthened my understanding of **JavaScript Classes**, **Modules**, **Local Storage**, and introduced me to **Webpack** for bundling.

Alhamdulillah

## What was needed to complete it:
- Modular JavaScript using ES6 `import/export`
- Creating and organizing logic with **Classes**
- Using **Local Storage** to persist data between sessions
- Webpack configuration for bundling assets and code
- Clean UI and responsive layout using **Flexbox** and basic **CSS Grid**

## Challenges that I’ve overcome:
- Setting up and debugging **Webpack** configuration from scratch
- Handling **Local Storage** integration and syncing with app state
- Maintaining modular and clean code structure across multiple files
- Making the app responsive across different screen sizes

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript (ES6)
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)
- Webpack
